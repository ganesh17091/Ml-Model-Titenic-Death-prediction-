# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a beginner-level **Machine Learning classification model** built using **scikit-learn** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the **end-to-end ML workflow**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., Sex)  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Building ML pipelines using `scikit-learn`  
- Training and evaluating classification models  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib 

## 📂 Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle / sklearn examples)

## ⚙️ ML Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess data (encoding & scaling)  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train ML model  
5. Evaluate model performance  

## 📈 Model Used
- Classification model using Logistic Regression  


## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try multiple ML algorithms  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Feature selection  
- Learn and implement **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**

## 📌 Learning Status
This project is part of my **Machine Learning learning journey**, and I’m continuously improving my understanding of ML algorithms and AI concepts.
